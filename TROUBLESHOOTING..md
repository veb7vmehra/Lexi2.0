## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, here are some steps to troubleshoot:

- **Reload IDE or Code Editor**: Sometimes, changes in environment variables or configurations are not recognized immediately. Try reloading or restarting your IDE or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

- **Re-run Setup Script**: If the issue persists, try running the setup script again to ensure all configurations and dependencies are correctly installed.

- **Reload Window**: After making changes or rerunning the setup, it might be helpful to reload the entire window of your IDE or code editor.

- **Check IP Whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas**: If you're unable to connect to MongoDB, ensure that your current IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas. Network access issues are a common cause of connection problems.

- **Check Environment Variables**: Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file. Incorrect or missing variables can lead to configuration issues.

- **Examine Error Logs**: Look at the error logs for specific error messages. They can often provide insights into what might be going wrong.

- **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. Connection issues can sometimes be mistaken for configuration problems.

- **Update Node.js and NPM**: Ensure that you are using the latest versions of Node.js and NPM. Outdated versions can sometimes cause compatibility issues.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to resolve common setup issues. If problems persist, consider reaching out to the support community or forums for additional help.
